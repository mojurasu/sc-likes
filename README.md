Export Soundcloud likes as JSON

## How to use
Since Soundcloud doesnt allow getting a Client ID the normal you'll have to get a Client ID by looking at the network tab while reloading the webinterface and getting it from one of the requests.

After you have your Client ID run the program and enter it when prompted to. Then enter the desired Username. After running for a bit it will output all likes as JSON.
